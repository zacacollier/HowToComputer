## Learn you a computer

Start with:
1. `howToComputer.md` and `hotkeys.md`

> Forgive me if `howToComputer.md` has some weird phrasing, it was originally supposed to just be some notes for a talk

And:

1. `commonCommands.md`
2. `commonLinux.md`
3. `git-tips.md`

If you're up for it, check out the `vim-keys.md` and follow this gradual approach (taken from the `vim.pdf`)
1. Run the `vimtutor` in your terminal
2. Download `vim-mode-plus` for Atom
3. Learn as you go. You can always fall back on vanilla keybindings / mouse if you need to.


Enjoy your new computer =D
